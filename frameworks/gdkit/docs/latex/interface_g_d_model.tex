\subsection{Detailed Description}
The \hyperlink{interface_g_d_model}{GDModel} is an object you should use as the model, or place to store data that needs to be read, and written. This will simplify handling thread safety with data access that many components in the application need to use -\/ you can also just copy data from here, and store in a sandboxed area or view which may not be concerned about thread safety. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
